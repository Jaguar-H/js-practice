1 Input HH  

there is no need to reverse the string the string is already same from both sides 

we can just print the string as it is 

```
```
2 Input "HJ"

here we need to print it backward we can use string index to print the string 

we took the the string length then we can use that to reverse it 

eg : "HJ"  length is 2 
but index is 0 , so for last we can do 2-1 to get j and then 2-2 for H 
and then we can just -1 then -2 to print it backward 
or we can store it into a string to print 

```
```
3 Input "HIM"

for this we will do same logic but we need to do it for 3 time 

we can also use for loop in the length of the string to make us les repeting in code 

as i did for loop it will work for every string i checked it for all test cases
